This post is the list of Intermediate-Advanced CSS resourcses which I would loved to have had during my progression as a CSS developer. Most of these resources assume the reader has a good understanding of basic CSS, they focus on techniques and patterns that help you produce maintainable, bug-free, and performant CSS.

There are 4 people in particular who have contributed a ton to the CSS community, I'll give each a short introduction and go over some of their most important contributions.

## [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/)
Creator of [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) and [Codepen](http://codepen.io/). Whenever I want to look up a CSS technique or best practives I always end up on [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/), there are always great articles on whatever I am looking for.

Techniques from [Media queries with Sass](http://css-tricks.com/media-queries-sass-3-2-and-codekit/) made it much easier to write beautiful Sass for responsive sites. Some of the articles are great refrences on browser incompatability like [Clear fix](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/) and others like [Sass style guide](http://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/) are full of great tips on how to structure and organize your Sass code.

## [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/)
Nicolas is a front-end developer at Twitter, core contributor to [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and author of a ton of great CSS articles and projects.

[About HTML semantics and front-end architecture](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/) Incredible artivel with tons of tips on writing semantic front end code. I really like the Structured Class names section.

[Normalize.css](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/) is a set of tag styles that normalizes user agent styles across browsers. It helps avoid some of the insanity that comes with writing cross browser CSS and is a more elegant and performant soloutina than reset.csss.

[Idiomatic-css](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) is a thourough CSS style guide full of great ways to keep your CSS organized on bigger projects, I especially like the declaration ordering strategy.
